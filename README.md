# INST327_Final_Project
MySQL based final project for Spring 2022 INST 327 course taken at the University of Maryland.
# Overview
This project revolves around a database that serves as an online video game commerce log & explores the entity relationships of customers ordering video games from various retailers (such as Amazon, Target, BestBuy, etc.) & how retailers establish relationships with order carriers. The consoles used, order carriers, and prices of the games are all real information, & were included to make the data as realistic as possible. However, the information pertaining to customers & employees used are fictitious. Additionally, the locations are real, but the individuals themselves are not.
# Installation
MySQL Workbench 8.0 is highly recommended to run project files.
