# INST327_Final_Project
MySQL based final project for Spring 2022 INST 327 course taken at the University of Maryland.
# Overview
This project revolves around a database that serves as an online video game commerce log & explores the entity relationships of customers ordering video games from various retailers (such as Amazon, Target, BestBuy, etc.) & how retailers establish relationships with order carriers. The consoles used, order carriers, and prices of the games are all real information, & were included to make the data as realistic as possible. However, the information pertaining to customers & employees used is fictitious. Additionally, the locations are real, but the individuals themselves are not. The Team 10 project ERD file is an Entity Relationship Diagram created in MySQL and shows the visualization between all the major entities within the project scope, specifically one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. The Team 10 queries text file contains the scripts created and used for the project, and the final project submission file contains the final report requirements that our team adhered to for project deliverables. The project backup folder is the backup file for the entire project.
# Installation
