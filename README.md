# INST327_Final_Project
MySQL based final project for Spring 2022 INST 327 course taken at the University of Maryland.
# Overview
This project revolves around a database that serves as an online video game commerce log. Essentially, the aim is to show the relationship of a customer ordering a video game from online retailers (such as Amazon, Target, BestBuy- etc.). The kind of information that the database will include consists of a gameâ€™s developer, as well as its particular genre, rating, & particular console. Our sample data includes both real & fictional information. The video games used, as well as publisher names, (and other attributes such as addresses, phone numbers, zip codes, etc.), are all real information that can be looked up. The consoles used, order carriers labeled, and prices of the games are all real information as well, & were included to make the data as realistic as possible. However, the information pertaining to customers & employees used are fictitious. Additionally, the locations are real, but the individuals themselves are not.
